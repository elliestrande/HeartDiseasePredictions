The dataset utalized includes features that can be used to predict which patients
are most likely to suffer heart disease in the near future. 
Our goal was to develop a machine-learning model that can predict people's 
likelihood of experiencing heart disease based on their statistics. 
We began with a thorough data analysis, then started developing predictive models.
