The dataset utalized includes features that can be used to predict which patients
are most likely to suffer heart disease in the near future. 
Our goal was to develop a machine-learning model that can predict people's 
likelihood of experiencing heart disease based on their statistics. 

This code includes the Data Analysis we conducted on the dataset as well as a few simple predictive models we attempted.
